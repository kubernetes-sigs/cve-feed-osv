  "summary": "Malicious container can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker-controlled container",
  "details": "A cluster configured to use an affected container networking implementation is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. By sending “rogue” router advertisements, a malicious container can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker-controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.",
